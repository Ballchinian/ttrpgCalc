# API Endpoints

This document describes the Pathfinder 2e Combat Calculator backend API. All routes are prefixed with `/api`.

## Authentication

Endpoints marked with 🔒 require a **Bearer access token** in the `Authorization` header.

The token is obtained from `/api/auth/login` and refreshed via `/api/auth/refresh`. The authentication and session routes additionally rely on an httpOnly **refresh-token cookie**. Authentication and import routes are rate limited.

# Authentication & Session

## POST `/api/auth/register`

Create a new account.

### Input

* Name
* Email
* Password (8-128 characters)

### Returns

* The created user (id, name, email)

---

## POST `/api/auth/login`

Authenticate with email and password.

### Returns

* Access token
* User (name, email)

### Notes

## POST `/api/auth/google`

Sign in with Google. The client obtains a Google ID token (via the Google Identity button) and posts it here.

### Input

* `credential` — the Google ID token (JWT)

### Effects

* Requires a Google-verified email; links to an existing account with the same email, or creates a new one.

### Returns

* Access token
* User (name, email)
* Sets the httpOnly refresh-token cookie

### Notes

* Rate limited. The client `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and the server `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` must be the same OAuth web client ID.

---

## POST `/api/auth/facebook`

Sign in with Facebook. The client obtains a Facebook user access token (via the Facebook JS SDK) and posts it here.

### Input

* `access_token` — the Facebook user access token

* Requires an email from Facebook; links to an existing account with the same email, or creates a new one.

### Returns

* Access token
* User (name, email)
* Sets the httpOnly refresh-token cookie

### Notes
